# Orthogtaphic Translator
Copyright 2022 Xavier Mercerweiss.

Converts pieces of text from one writing system to another based purely on the pronunciation of each word as expressed using the International Phonetic Alphabet. IPA data for any language may be utlized, and the characters associated with each phoneme as represented using the IPA may be altered. The IPA data and character mappings provided are designed around American English as spoken in the Western U.S. This data was sourced from <https://github.com/open-dict-data/ipa-dict>, and many thanks are given to that project's contributors.

The orthography provided alongside this project is the Feŋliʃ (Phenglish, Phonetic English) writing system, an orthography designed for American English in which every character represents exactly one sound, and every sound is represented by exactly one character. This project was created in order to facilitate the conversion of text into this orthography. This writing system is elaborated upon further in this document.

## The Feŋliʃ Writing System
Feŋliʃ (Phenglish), short for phonetic English, is an alternative English writing system in which every letter makes exactly one sound and every sound is written using exactly one letter. The writing system heavily utilizes diacritical marks, though does not reflect the meanings of these marks in other languages. Several sounds represented by consonant pairs (ie: th, sh) are assigned characters not utilized in the Latin script, such as þ and ʃ.

NOTE: This writing system was created to reflect American English as spoken in the Western U.S., and will best reflect English as spoken in this region.
